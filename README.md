# Titanic Classification - Learning Project

This is a learning project to practice the E2E classification project process. Main focuses were classification, transformers and pipelines. There was also some work around hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. 

This project was completed in order to:
- Practice the E2E data science process.
- Learn how to participate in a Kaggle Competition
- Practice classification and pipelines
- Practice proper documentation

The project outcome is not in focus of this project, hence I have not dedicated a siginificant amount into hyperparameter tuning and improving the score. The goal was to practice the concepts.
