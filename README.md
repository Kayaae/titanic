# Titanic Classification - Learning Project

This is a classification learning project done using Jupyter Notebook. The purpose of the project is to solve the well known Titanic problem: which passengers will survive the Titanic crash?

Main focuses in this project are:
- classification models
- transformers
- pipelines
- hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
